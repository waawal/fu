FU!
===

**DNSBL** checking *SMTP-Proxy*

FU is a simple yet powerful SMTP Proxy that checks the incoming connections against a list of preconfigured DNSBL's. Based on the weights assigned to the lists and a threshhold it makes a decision weather it should proxy the email to the upstream or hang up (close) the connection.

FU is optimized to run in a virtual machine environment. It should be able to handle a couple of hundred incoming connections per second on a single core system/vm.

Features

* Round Robin Load Balancing of Backends.
